# Contributing to BoxLite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BoxLite!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (stable)
- macOS (Apple Silicon) or Linux (x86_64/ARM64) with KVM
- Python 3.10+ (for Python SDK development)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/boxlite-labs/boxlite.git
cd boxlite

# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build
make setup
make dev:python
```

For detailed build instructions, see [docs/guides](./docs/guides/README.md#building-from-source).

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

Key test entry points:

- `make test` / `make test:all` - full test matrix (unit + integration)
- `make test:unit` - all unit suites
- `make test:integration` - all integration suites
- `make test:all:python` - Python unit + integration suites
- `make test:all:c` - C SDK suite via CMake/CTest

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/boxlite-labs/boxlite/issues)
- Include OS, architecture, and BoxLite version
- Provide minimal reproduction steps

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run quality and tests (`make lint && make fmt:check && make test`)
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

Follow the [Rust Style Guide](./docs/development/rust-style.md) which includes:

- [Microsoft Rust Guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines)
- BoxLite-specific patterns (async-first, centralized errors, thread-safe types)

**Quick reference:**

- `make fmt` / `make fmt:check` for formatting checks
- `make lint` / `make lint:fix` for lint checks and safe autofix
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
